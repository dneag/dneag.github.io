DDK Review was a semester-long Database Management group project completed by myself and
fellow classmates, Doug Rudy and Kent Hoang.  The plan was to create a video game search-and-review
website where users would rate games' tags rather than giving a single score.  While there is 
still much that can be improved, we are quite happy with what we accomplished for the class.
